# CYBR473_Assignment3_Malware
This is my submission for the third assignment for Victoria University of Wellington CYBR473 Malware Analysis.
The goal of this assignment was to make a simple key logger with a Command and Control (C&C) Server connection.

the C&C server code is "client.cpp" and can be compiled using "g++ -o client.exe client.cpp -lws2_32".
the malwares code is "malware.cpp" and can be compile using "g++ -o test.exe malware.cpp -lws2_32 -lwininet"
